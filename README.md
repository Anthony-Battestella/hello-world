Hello, my name is Anthony Battestela and I am currently pursuing a BS in computer science with a minor in cybersecurity from Florida Atlantic University. I am 23 years old, live in Orlando Florida, and am hoping to pursue a career in either cybersecurity or software engineering in the near future. In my free time I love playing water polo and travelling with freinds, and I hope to add programing to that list very soon.
